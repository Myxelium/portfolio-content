# Music

Music production is one of my hobbies, I started first quarter of 2017 and have constantly been improving my production skills since then. I'm also member of a band that makes rock/pop music.


### What are you working on right now?
I'm currently on a break, but I always have unfinished projects laying around waiting to be finished and released.
